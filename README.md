# Plants vs. Zombies Money Farm AutoHotKey Script.
A macro that plants your plants in the appropriate fashion for beating the mini game last stand and making a money farm in the process. This will save you lots of time farming as you don't have to constantly replant your whole defense manually if you are saving up for something.

# GAME REQUIREMENTS:
- Access to the "Last Stand" minigame.
- Purchase the Gold Magnet for $3000 from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies.
- Purchase the Gloom Shroom for $7500 from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies.
- Purchase the 9th seed slot for $20000 from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies.
  - Total price for the above is $30500 coins. This can be unlocked with relatively little effort if you save your coins up effectively until you unlock the Last Stand                 minigame. The initial investment does seem a bit pricey at first, but given it can be just about paid off in 3-4 games of Last Stand (it averages about $9000 per game), it is     a worthwhile investment. 

# SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
- Install https://www.autohotkey.com/ if you are running the AHK file. If you do not have this, the .exe file is also listed above and will suffice, though AutoHotKey is amazing     and you should use it and learn about it.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Run Plants vs. Zombies in windowed mode.
2. Click the "Last Stand" minigame in the minigames section.
3. Select your plants in the following order, or else the script will not work:
   - | Marigold | Lillypad | Magnet-shroom | Gold Magnet | Garlic | Fume-shroom | Gloom-shroom | Coffee Bean | Pumpkin |
4. When you are ready to plant your plants, simply hit the "F10" key on your keyboard and everything will be planted ready for money making. You may go back into full screen if you prefer, the script is just very hard to make if you're taking full screen into account.

# NOTES:
- This defense will beat the Last Stand minigame as well as farm coins for you, so if you have not beaten it yet, this will do it for you too, and you will get a lovely diamond at   the end.
- This has only been tested on a 1080p monitor, I think it should work on any resolution though as the script is based on the resolution of the window, not the resolution of the     monitor.
- Credit to the layout of the defense goes to this YouTube video https://youtu.be/04wnN7pfUo8. I don't know if they were first but it certainly seems to be the most   popular video. I reccomend watching it for additional instructions on what to do during the battle.
- This defense will generally earn you about $9000 coins for every time you beat the minigame.
